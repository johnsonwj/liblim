NAMING CONVENTIONS FOR HISTOGRAMS

Histograms produced by the doHists program are stored in hists/ and named
according to the following conventions.

If the histograms correpsond to Higgs events, the first section of
the filename is "proc_" where proc is the Higgs production mode
(ggF, VBF, WH, ZH). The second part represents the decay: htt is H->tautau,
htm is H->taumu, and so forth.

Non-Higgs events are just named according to the process that the histograms
correspond to.

All events have as the last term in the name "_CTX", which stands for
"cut tolerance X". Cuts are done in terms of the number of cuts left
INCLUDING and AFTER the first failure; at the time of this writing, there
are 10 cuts total, so a cut result of 4 means that the seventh cut failed
(so there were 4 cuts left over, including the one that failed).

CT0: except for the cutflow histogram itself, the histograms only contain
events which passed all cuts.

CT4: Presently LFV-specific events account for the final four cuts in the
cut flow. CT4 therefore means that the histograms contain all of the cuts
except for the LFV-specific ones: they still require a tagged tau_had,
charge correlation, and basic requirements on eta and tau pt.
